Today we publish the new Gaia Sky web site. If you are reading this, you obviously know it. I've been working on this for a while, and, even though it is not yet finished, I think it is now ready to be deployed. So far, we have used the website of [our institute](https://zah.ari.uni-heidelberg.de), which uses the Typo3 CMS, as our home page. In a few days, I'll make it point to this new site.

It is easier to add content to, and easier to maintain. I also happen to think it looks better. I hope you enjoy it.

The canonical URL, for now, is this:
