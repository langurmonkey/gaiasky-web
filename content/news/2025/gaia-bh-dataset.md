As of today, we have consolidated the three Gaia DR3 black hole datasets (BH1, with key `system-gaia-bh1`, BH2, with key `system-gaia-bh2`, and BH3, with key `system-gaia-bh3`) into a single dataset that contains all three systems. The new dataset is called "Gaia black holes" and has the key `system-gaia-bhs`.

Below is the link to the new black holes dataset in the resources section. As always, the dataset is already available for download from the datasets manager. We **strongly recommend** to delete the old `system-gaia-bh1`|`2`|`3` if you download this new dataset. Otherwise, you'll end up with duplicated objects.
