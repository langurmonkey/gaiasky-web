We regret to inform our users that our server, hosting Gaia Sky packages, datasets, and documentation, is currently inaccessible from external networks. This is due to precautionary measures taken by the University Computing Center (URZ) at the University of Heidelberg.

For more details on these measures, please refer to the official announcement from the URZ: [Precautionary Measures by URZ](https://www.urz.uni-heidelberg.de/en/precautionary-measures).

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will keep you updated as the situation evolves.
