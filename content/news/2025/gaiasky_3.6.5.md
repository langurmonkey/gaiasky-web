ðŸ“¢ Today, coinciding with the end of the sky-scanning phase of Gaia, we publish Gaia Sky 3.6.5. The most noteworthy addition is the introduction of the volume rendering infrastructure.

## Features
- Add support for volume rendering. The infrastructure is in place with a new archetype `Volume`. This is necessary for the new volumetric aurora dataset and volume nebulae in NGC2000.
- Add 'volumes and effects' catalog type.
- Enable `"flip"` attribute for `box`es/`cube`s in mesh builders.
- Add `"cameraCollision"` attribute to bodies.
- Shader include statement now supports targets in datasets.
- Add on-demand re-compilation of post-processing shaders from their source files, in runtime.
- Add new attribute `renderLabel` to label component. This enables/disables the actual rendering of the label.
- Increase default quality of FXAA filter, provide a simpler implementation (disabled by default), and enable hot shader reloading for FXAA effect.
- Update Gaia Sky icon.
- Add Bluesky link to readme file and about page.

## Bug Fixes
- Position of context menu in dataset manager is off.
- Unknown dataset types crash Gaia Sky. Fixes [#787](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/787).
- Do not crash when reloading non-compiling glsl shaders.
- Wrong size initialization for ray-marched objects.
- Prevent non-focusable objects to appear in search results and to be set as camera focus.
- Enable atmosphere/cloud procedural generation even when the surface is disabled due to cubemaps being used.
- Do not attempt setting a window icon in Wayland, it is not supported and results in a (harmless) crash.
- Position tracking does not work with objects in orbital elements group.
- Correctly populate window width and height in preferences dialog.

## Build System
- Update configuration file version number. This implies that your old configuration file gets overridden with the new version during the first startup of the new Gaia Sky version.
- Update to LibGDX 1.13.1.
