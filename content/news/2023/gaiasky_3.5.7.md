- Add floating-point completion rates to billboard datasets.
- Combine SSR with cubemap reflections to fill in parts that reflect to off-screen locations.
- Add Debian build files. Add Makefile. Add `createDebian` task to gradle build script.
- Updated Bulgarian translation.

## Bug Fixes
- Crash when enabling 'Others' component type at startup in VR.
- Sizing of datasets scroll pane with expand/collapse groups is incorrect in some instances.
- Add free space check before downloads, and clean up properly after a failed extraction operation. Fixes [#744](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/744).
- Auto-scroll to target when cycling through UI elements with gamepad left stick. Selection and action with gamepad in dataset manager window.
- Zero-length keyframed path crashes the 'normalize times' action. Fixes [#741](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/741).
- Add missing, untranslated strings to I18N files. Fixes [#740](https://codeberg.org/gaiasky/gaiasky/issues/740).
- Start and dataset manager buttons do not scale horizontally with content.
- Ascending node parameter in rotation component does not apply correctly. Bump source version to 3.5.7, for new data is needed.
- Recursive tile lookup in sparse virtual textures module does not work correctly.
