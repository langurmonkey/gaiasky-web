ðŸ“¢ Gaia Sky 3.5.4-1 available now!

<!--more-->


## Bug Fixes
- move action stuttering on some systems due to no input changes since last sync.
- application title in loading screen squashes the logo.

## Build System
- set bundled JRE version to 17 instead of 20; seemingly, there are non-negligible performance issues with the JRE 20 on some configurations.

You can get this release in [our repository](https://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/gaiasky/releases//3.5.4-1.c31b73416/).
