ðŸ“¢ Gaia Sky 3.5.4 available now!

<!--more-->


## Features
- Add square recursive grid style, additionally to the existing circular concentric rings.
- Add diagonal lines at 30 and 60 degrees to the circular recursive grid.
- Redesign time pane layout and widgets (warp slider, play/pause, information boxes, etc.) in controls window.
- Upgrade internal version numbering to include a sequence number within the revision (major.minor.revision-sequence). It should be backwards compatible, but starting with this version, internal version numbers have at least 7 digits instead of 5.
- Bump source version number.
- Refactor separator UI elements.
- Redesign loading screen to follow welcome screen style.
