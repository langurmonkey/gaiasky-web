After several months of [downtime](/news/2025/server-down-update), we are excited and relieved to announce that the **Gaia Sky server is officially back online** and accessible to the public!

Thanks to our colleagues of the IT department in our institute, we could open up our server so that Gaia Sky users can again download the application and the data packages without restrictions.

We know it has been a long wait, and we appreciate the patience the community has shown during this university-wide incident.

Everything you need to get back to exploring the cosmos is ready for download:

* **[Release Packages](/downloads):** You can once again download the latest installers for Linux, Windows, and macOS.
* **[Datasets](/resources/datasets):** The full catalog of datasets, from the base star catalogs to the high-resolution texture packs, is again reachable via the internal dataset manager and as manual downloads.
* **[Documentation](/docs):** The Gaia Sky documentation pages are also open now.
